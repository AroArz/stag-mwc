This repo contains the code for a Snakemake workflow of the Metagenomic
Workflow Collaboration (mwc). The current focus is a barebones metagenomics
analysis workflow to produce primary output files from several different
metagenomic analysis tools.

## Usage

### Step 1: Install workflow
<!--download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/mwc/releases). -->

If you simply want to use this workflow, clone the repository: `git clone
git@github.com:boulund/mwc`. If you intend to modify or further develop this
workflow, you are welcome to fork this reposity. Please consider sharing
potential improvements via a pull request.

If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the
authors by citing the URL of this repository and, when available, its DOI.

### Step 2: Configure workflow

Configure the workflow according to your needs by editing the file
`config.yaml`. The most common changes include setting the paths to input and
output folders, and configuring what steps of the workflow should be included
when running the workflow.

### Step 3: Execute workflow

Test your configuration by performing a dry-run via

    snakemake -n

Execute the workflow locally via

    snakemake --cores $N

using `$N` cores or run it in a cluster environment via

    snakemake --cluster qsub --jobs 100

or

    snakemake --drmaa --jobs 100

See the [Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io) for further
details on how to run Snakemake workflows on cluster resources.

If you are using [conda](https://conda.io), it is easy to get started by using the 
`--use-conda` flag:

	snakemake --use-conda

This will run the different processes of the workflow in separate conda environments,
which will automatically take care of installing the required dependencies.


### Automatic database download
The workflow offers steps that can automatically download the required
reference databases. Note that this step is normally only required once, as
previously downloaded databases are reused.


## Testing

The ambition is that mwc will contain extensive tests to verify functionality.
Test cases are in the subfolder `.tests`. They should be executed via continuous
integration with Travis CI. 


## Contributing

1. Fork or clone the repository.
2. Create a branch with a descriptive name based on your intended changes using
   dashes to separate words, e.g. `branch-to-add-megahit-assembly-step`
3. Insert your code into the respective folders, i.e. `scripts`, `rules` and
   `envs`. Define the entry point of the workflow in the `Snakefile` and the
   main configuration in the `config.yaml` file.
4. Commit changes to your local fork/clone.
5. Create a pull request (PR) with some motivation behind the work you have
   done and possibly some explanations for tricky bits.
